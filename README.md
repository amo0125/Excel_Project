<h1>Yu Chiang: Aspiring Data Analyst</h1>
<p>Hello there! My name is Yu and I am an aspiring data analyst. I have completed several data analysis projects that showcase my skills in SQL, Excel, Tableau, and web scraping. Here are some of my recent projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SQL Query Practice:</strong> I have worked on several SQL queries that involve complex joins and subqueries to analyze data from a Vaccination database. I have also written queries to update and delete data.</li>
  <li><strong>Excel Dashboard Analytics:</strong> I created an Excel dashboard to analyze bicycle sales data by age, sex, commuting distance, and job type. The dashboard includes charts, pivot tables, and slicers that allow for easy filtering and exploration of the data.</li>
   <li><strong>Amazon Web Scraper:</strong> I developed a web scraper using Python and Beautiful Soup to extract product data from Amazon. The scraper can be used to analyze pricing, reviews, and other product attributes.</li>
  <li><strong>Tableau Project:</strong> I used Tableau to analyze Airbnb pricing data for Tokyo in 2023. The project involved cleaning and aggregating data, creating visualizations, and interpreting the results.</li>
